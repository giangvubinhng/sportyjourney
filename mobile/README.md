# Sportbook

BJJ session tracking app (Expo + PocketBase). Supports **light and dark theme** with primary color **#1fa358**.

## Get started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. **Environment** – Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `EXPO_PUBLIC_POCKETBASE_URL` (e.g. `http://192.168.1.x:8090` for device; `http://10.0.2.2:8090` for Android emulator).

3. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   bun run start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

Project structure: **`app/`** (screens), **`api/`** (PocketBase, auth, sessions), **`components/`** (UI), **`constants/`** (theme), **`lib/`** (form/validation), **`types/`** (shared types). See **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** for architecture and onboarding.

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
bun run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
